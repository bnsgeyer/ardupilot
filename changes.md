So far...

I commented out unwanted code (full deletes later) in Arducopter/Copter.cpp
I made notes in Tools/scripts/build_options.py of what to disable; the file uses a binary system where...
    0 Enable
    1 Disable

Need to have:
    I2C connection with the Raspberry pi for data transmit
    Possible: connection to a separate app to enable editing to data and analyzing data
